# Fake-News-Detection

# problem statement

Not just hackers breaking into accounts and transmitting fraudulent information are the issue. What we refer to as "Fake News" is the greater issue here. A fake news report is one that is untrue, has no verified facts, sources, or quotes, and is made up entirely.

Fake news is also when someone spreads incorrect information by impersonating another person or a trustworthy source. The majority of the time, those that spread this incorrect information do so with an objective. This purpose may be political, economic, or aimed at altering people's behaviour or way of thinking.

Today, there are innumerable sources of fake news, the most of which are automated bots that, being computers, never grow tired and keep going. to constantly propagate incorrect information

Over the past five years, significant research has shown that there are strong relationships between the transmission of misleading information and elections, as well as with public sentiment on many issues.

Due to the fact that the bots are growing smarter and fooling us, the issue is genuine and difficult to resolve. In order to enhance social media, communication, and to stop misunderstanding in the world, we need better systems that help us comprehend the patterns of fake news. It is not always easy to tell when information is accurate or false.

# Purpose

I'll outline numerous techniques in this short code for identifying false news using information gathered from several articles. But similar methods can be used in many contexts. I'll teach how to load, clean, and analyse data using Python code for programmers and experts. Then, using machine learning models, we'll carry out a categorization task.
